#read peg decision (@variable) and move that card to the peg stack (move based on size of stack)
#if new round, go through stack (if not empty) and "shade" the cards a bit (reset sum to 0)
#update the peg sum (add label if first peg)
#update peg form if not last peg

#if it is the last peg, render 'hands_counted'?? We can still leave peg stack alone if we want to
